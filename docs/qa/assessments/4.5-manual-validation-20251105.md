- Characteristics: Exponential decay, bubble-like character
- Bit rate: 148 kbps
- Size: 3.4KB

**Child-Appropriateness Analysis:**
- ✅ **Frequency Range:** 300Hz is in the pleasant, mid-range spectrum (not harsh)

### 3. warning-chime.mp3 ✅ APPROVED (WITH NOTE)

**Technical Specifications:**
- Duration: 0.84 seconds (836ms)
- Frequency: C major chord (523Hz + harmonics)

C major chord has universally positive emotional associations. Bell-like quality is culturally associated with gentle notifications (not alarms). Duration (0.84s) provides sufficient awareness without being intrusive.

**Important Note for AC3 Compliance:**
The story specifies "pleasant chime for warnings (not jarring)" - this sound **fully complies**. The major chord and bell tone are explicitly non-jarring. This is an **appropriate warning sound for children** - it alerts without frightening.

Longer duration (1.3s) is appropriate for grace video notification - a significant state change requiring emotional comfort.

**Context Note:**
This sound plays when child reaches daily limit and receives grace video - a potentially emotionally charged moment. The peaceful, harp-like quality is **perfectly suited** to provide reassurance and positive transition.
