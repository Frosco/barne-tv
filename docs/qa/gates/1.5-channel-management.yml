nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent security implementation, significantly improved since previous review.

      **Improvements Since Last Review:**
      - Rate limiting implemented with slowapi 0.1.9
      - Login endpoint: 20 requests/minute (stricter for brute-force prevention)
      - Admin endpoints: 100 requests/minute
      - Custom Norwegian error messages for 429 responses
      - Proper test environment bypass via TESTING flag

      **Current Security Posture:**
      - Input validation comprehensive (SQL injection, XSS, ReDoS, length limits)
      - XSS prevention using textContent (not innerHTML)
      - SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries (TIER 1 Rule 6)
      - Bcrypt password hashing with proper salt (TIER 1 Rule 4)
      - Authentication checks on all admin endpoints
      - Rate limiting prevents brute-force and DoS attacks
      - No sensitive data leakage in error messages

      **Minor Recommendations:**
      - Consider rate limiting GET /admin/login page (very low priority)
      - Consider CSRF tokens (low priority - SameSite cookie provides protection)

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Good performance for typical use cases. Previous CONCERNS status upgraded to PASS
      because caching absence is an optimization opportunity, not a functional defect.

      **Strengths:**
      - Large channel fetches (5000+ videos) handled well with pagination
      - Partial fetch handling prevents timeout blocking
      - Quota checking before API calls
      - Safety valve at 100 pages prevents infinite loops
      - Rate limiting prevents server overload

      **Optimization Opportunities:**
      - No caching of source list (database query on every page load)
        Impact: Low - typical usage has few sources, queries are fast
        Priority: Defer until performance monitoring shows need
      - Video detail batching at 50 per request could be tuned

      **Recommendations:**
      - Add performance monitoring first
      - Implement caching when metrics indicate need (not preemptively)
      - Consider lazy loading for very large channels (>1000 videos)

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent reliability with graceful degradation, improved since previous review.

      **Improvements:**
      - All 35 integration tests now passing (was 22/25)
      - Fixed error response standardization issues
      - Added NotFoundError for consistent error handling

      **Current Strengths:**
      - Retry logic with exponential backoff (0s, 1s, 2s)
      - Partial fetch handling returns successfully fetched data
      - Comprehensive error handling with logging
      - Norwegian error messages for user clarity
      - No data loss on network failures
      - Rate limiting prevents cascading failures

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      High code quality maintained after QA fixes.

      **Code Quality:**
      - Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
      - Excellent documentation with docstrings
      - Risk mitigation comments throughout (SEC-002, DATA-002, PERF-002)
      - Minimal technical debt (2 TODO comments only)
      - Consistent patterns across codebase

      **Test Maintainability:**
      - 229 tests total (up from 219)
      - Clear test naming and organization
      - Proper use of fixtures and mocking
      - Good test isolation

      **Minor Technical Debt:**
      - E402 linting warning in middleware.py (intentional, should add # noqa)
      - Dev mode flags in routes.py (2 TODO comments)
      - Test configuration for running all tests together

deployment_readiness:
  status: READY
  notes: |
    Story is production-ready with no blocking issues.

    **Deployment Approval:**
    - All 10 acceptance criteria met ✅
    - TIER 1 safety compliance: 100% ✅
    - All critical security concerns resolved ✅
    - All integration tests passing ✅
    - Excellent code quality ✅
    - No regressions detected ✅

    **Confidence Level:** High

    **Known Optimization Opportunities:**
    - E2E tests (nice-to-have, not blocking)
    - Caching layer (performance optimization for future)
    - Test configuration (infrastructure improvement)

    **Recommendation:** Deploy to production. Monitor performance metrics
    and create follow-up tasks only if metrics indicate need for optimizations.
