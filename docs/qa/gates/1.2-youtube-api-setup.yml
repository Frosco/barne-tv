# FINAL ASSESSMENT
# ============================================================================

final_decision:
  gate_status: "PASS"
  rationale: "All critical and high risks successfully mitigated. According to gate decision criteria: 'If all critical risks mitigated + P0 tests pass â†’ PASS'. SEC-001 verified passed (no real keys in git), DATA-002 passed (perfect UTC handling), all other risks mitigated or waived. Implementation demonstrates best-in-class quality standards."

  quality_highlights:
    - "Zero implementation issues found in code review"
    - "100% TIER 1 compliance with all safety rules"
    - "Comprehensive testing: 25 tests, 13 TIER 1, all passing in 0.42s"
    - "Outstanding documentation: 400+ line setup guide exceeds expectations"
    - "Perfect security: No secrets in git, proper environment variable usage"
    - "Risk-based engineering: Conservative quota buffer, defensive error handling"

  expected_outcome: "Story ready for Done. This represents the quality bar for all future stories."

  team_acknowledgment: "The development team delivered exceptional work across all dimensions - implementation, testing, documentation, and security. This story demonstrates mastery of the coding standards and thoughtful engineering with risk awareness."
