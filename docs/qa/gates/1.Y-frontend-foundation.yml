# Code quality metrics
code_quality:
  overall_rating: 9.5
  strengths:
    - 'Outstanding CSS design system with complete 14-color palette and all design tokens'
    - 'Exceptional 500+ line README documentation significantly exceeding requirements'
    - 'Modern ESLint 9.x flat config (forward-compatible, prevents future migration)'
    - 'Excellent accessibility features (sr-only, focus-visible, reduced motion, touch optimizations)'
    - 'Clean, maintainable code following all standards with zero code smells'
    - 'Proper Vite configuration preventing path resolution issues'

    - name: 'ESLint Flat Config'
      original_spec: '.eslintrc.json (legacy format)'
      implementation: 'eslint.config.js (flat config)'
      rationale: 'ESLint 9.x deprecated legacy format. Flat config is new standard, required in ESLint 10.x.'
      status: APPROVED

    - name: 'Vite Config Root Setting'
      original_spec: 'root: "frontend"'
      implementation: 'root setting omitted'
      rationale: 'vite.config.js is inside frontend/ directory. Setting root would cause frontend/frontend/ resolution.'
