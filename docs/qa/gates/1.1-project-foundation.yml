story: "1.1"
story_title: "Project Foundation and Basic Server Setup"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent foundation implementation with proper coding standards and security measures, but AC 9 not fully satisfied - admin password hash is empty string (procedural issue requiring password to be set via init script)."

# Issues requiring attention

    severity: medium
    finding: "Admin password not set - database initialized but admin_password_hash is empty string instead of bcrypt hash"
    suggested_action: "Run database initialization with password: uv run python backend/db/init_db.py <secure_password>"

# Evidence from comprehensive review
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 0  # No tests required for foundation story
  risks_identified: 1  # Admin password not set
  files_reviewed: 13  # All Python files
  files_refactored: 4  # queries.py, init_db.py, 2 service files
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12]  # 11 of 12 ACs fully satisfied
    ac_gaps: [9]  # AC 9: Admin password not set

# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "TIER 1 security rules properly implemented. Bcrypt password hashing correct, SQL injection prevention verified (all queries parameterized), no secrets committed to git. Only issue is password not set (procedural, not code defect)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Appropriate design for single-user deployment. Database indexing strategy excellent with 6 indexes on videos table. WAL mode enabled for concurrency."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling added during review. Try/except/finally blocks ensure proper cleanup. Context managers for database access ensure automatic rollback on errors."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality with comprehensive docstrings, type hints (Python 3.11 syntax), clear module organization, and well-documented TIER 1/2/3 safety rules in code."

# Detailed recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Set admin password by running init script with password argument"
      refs: ["backend/db/init_db.py"]
      priority: high
      reason: "Required for admin interface to function. Currently password hash is empty string."

  future:
    - action: "Add integration tests for database initialization in Story 1.2 (Testing Infrastructure)"
      refs: ["backend/db/init_db.py", "backend/db/schema.sql"]
      priority: low
      reason: "Would catch initialization issues like empty password hash in CI/CD pipeline."

    - action: "Consider adding database migration tool for future schema changes"
      refs: ["backend/db/"]
      priority: low
      reason: "Current approach uses schema.sql which works for initial setup but doesn't handle migrations."

# Risk summary
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 1  # Admin password not set
    low: 0

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Set admin password via init script before deploying to any environment"

    monitor:
      - "Verify password hash is bcrypt format (starts with $2b$) in settings table"
      - "Consider adding health check that validates critical settings are configured"
