nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      All security measures verified via passing tests:
      - XSS prevention validated (textContent usage)
      - SQL injection prevention validated (parameterized queries)
      - UTC timezone validated (ISO 8601 Zulu format)
      - Time limit accuracy validated (manual_play/grace_play exclusion)
      - Input validation validated (count parameter range)
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      Implementation: PASS - Efficient SQL queries, lazy image loading, minimal API payload.
      Validation: CONCERNS - No performance benchmarks.
      Risk: Low for MVP (single family, <500 videos expected).
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Error handling validated via unit and integration tests.
      All implemented tests pass (94/94 = 100%).
      TIER 1 safety rules fully validated.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent code structure with proper separation of concerns (routes → services → database).
      Comprehensive docstrings, type hints, and clear function signatures.
      Test architecture well-designed with unit/integration/safety separation.

      refs:
        - 'docs/qa/assessments/2.1-test-design-20251022.md'
      priority: medium

      rationale: 'Child-facing interface benefits from comprehensive visual/UX validation before production deployment.'

        - 'Option A (Recommended): Create and execute manual E2E testing checklist (2-4 hours)'
        - 'Option B (Ideal): Implement 14 E2E test scenarios with Playwright (8-12 hours)'

acknowledgments: |
  Outstanding work by the development team!

  Both critical blockers resolved quickly and correctly:
  1. UTC timezone format fix applied exactly as recommended (single line change)
  2. Database isolation achieved via proper test fixture usage
  3. All 94 tests now pass with 100% success rate
  4. Test architecture demonstrates excellent design

  The story is production-ready and represents high-quality implementation of a child-facing
  interface with comprehensive safety testing. E2E test gap is a quality enhancement
  opportunity, not a blocker.
