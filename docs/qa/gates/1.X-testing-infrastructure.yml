# Evidence from comprehensive review
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 5  # 2 backend (test_health.py), 3 frontend (sample.test.js)
  risks_identified: 0  # No functional risks identified
  files_reviewed: 8  # pytest.ini, vitest.config.js, conftest.py, test files, package files, README
  files_refactored: 0  # No refactoring needed
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # All 10 ACs fully satisfied
    ac_gaps: []  # No gaps

# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Test fixtures use in-memory databases ensuring proper isolation. No credentials in test code. Proper cleanup with context managers."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance - backend tests <1s, frontend tests <100ms. happy-dom is 2x faster than jsdom. V8 coverage provider is native and fast."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All 5 tests passing (2 backend, 3 frontend). Proper fixture cleanup patterns established. Stable dependencies with exact versions."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality with comprehensive docstrings, Python 3.11+ type hints, clear helper functions. README documentation thorough and helpful."

# Detailed recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking items

  future:
    - action: "Remove duplicate frontend/tests/ directory structure"
      refs: ["frontend/tests/"]
      priority: low
      reason: "Appears to be artifact from Task 3 directory creation. Confusing structure but no functional impact. Can be addressed in next story."

    - action: "Create missing root test directories for completeness"
      refs: ["tests/integration/", "tests/e2e/", "tests/helpers/", "tests/fixtures/", "tests/mocks/"]
      priority: low
      reason: "Required by source-tree.md specification but not needed yet (infrastructure story only, no tests require these directories)."

    - action: "Create backend test subdirectories"
      refs: ["tests/backend/services/", "tests/backend/db/", "tests/backend/safety/", "tests/backend/security/"]
      priority: low
      reason: "Required by source-tree.md but not needed yet. Will be created naturally as tests are added in future stories."

    - action: "Optional: Document httpx==0.27.0 in tech-stack.md"
      refs: ["docs/architecture/tech-stack.md", "pyproject.toml"]
      priority: negligible
      reason: "Dependency was added (required by TestClient) but not documented in tech stack. Properly justified in Dev Agent Record."

# Architectural decisions reviewed

    assessment: "NECESSARY - properly justified"
