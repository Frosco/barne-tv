  Gate Status: PASS (upgraded from CONCERNS)
  Quality Score: 98/100 (Exceptional)

  RATIONALE FOR PASS (UPGRADED FROM CONCERNS):

  This is a comprehensive third review that verified all fixes implemented by the dev team after the second review's CONCERNS gate. All blocking issues have been resolved and the implementation is production-ready.

  1. ALL CRITICAL BLOCKERS RESOLVED:
     ✅ SQLite threading fix verified working (15/15 backend tests passing, was 0/15)
     ✅ TIER 1 safety tests 100% passing (78/78 tests) - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT MET
     ✅ Frontend tests 98.4% passing (60/61, 1 properly documented skip, was 21/23)
     ✅ Grace consumption state machine implemented and verified
     ✅ Backend test video IDs fixed to 11-character YouTube format
     ✅ Frontend test environment issues resolved

  2. PRODUCTION CODE QUALITY IS EXCEPTIONAL:
     ✅ All 12 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified
     ✅ All TIER 1 safety rules verified in code AND runtime (78/78 tests)
     ✅ Comprehensive error handling with Norwegian user messages
     ✅ Excellent inline documentation explaining all safety decisions
     ✅ Perfect architecture adherence (Routes → Services → Database)
     ✅ No defects found in production code
     ✅ No security vulnerabilities identified
     ✅ No performance concerns
     ✅ Exemplary coding standards throughout

  3. TEST COVERAGE IS COMPREHENSIVE:
     ✅ Backend: 100% of Story 2.2 functionality tested (15/15 tests)
     ✅ Frontend: 98.4% passing with proper YouTube IFrame API mocking
     ✅ TIER 1: 100% safety-critical functionality verified (78/78 tests)
     ✅ Overall: 153/154 tests passing (99.4%)
     ✅ Integration: Structure in place (non-blocking, unit coverage sufficient)

  4. REQUIREMENTS FULLY MET:
     ✅ All 12 acceptance criteria: IMPLEMENTED and VERIFIED
     ✅ All TIER 1 safety rules: VERIFIED (code + runtime)
     ✅ All TIER 2 functionality rules: VERIFIED
     ✅ All TIER 3 code quality rules: VERIFIED

  5. QUALITY BAR EXCEEDED:
     Target: ≥85% test pass rate → Achieved: 99.4% ✅
     Target: 100% TIER 1 tests → Achieved: 100% (78/78) ✅
     Target: All ACs implemented → Achieved: 12/12 ✅
     Target: No blocking issues → Achieved: 0 blockers ✅

  WHY NOT CONCERNS OR FAIL:
  - No critical issues remaining (all resolved)
  - No high-severity issues remaining (all resolved)
  - No medium-severity issues remaining (all resolved)
  - 1 skipped test is properly documented and justified (test environment limitation)
  - Integration tests are nice-to-have, not blocking (unit coverage is comprehensive)
  - Production code is ready for immediate deployment

  DEPLOYMENT READINESS: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION

  This story represents exemplary software engineering:
  - Comprehensive implementation (all 12 ACs)
  - Thorough testing (153/154 tests passing = 99.4%)
  - Excellent documentation (inline TIER 1/2/3 comments)
  - Complete safety rule compliance (78/78 TIER 1 tests)
  - Production-ready code quality

  The dev team has delivered exceptional work that meets and exceeds all quality standards.
