# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Eliminate 100% of inappropriate content exposure by restricting videos exclusively to parent-approved YouTube channels and playlists
- Enable independent video selection for children ages 2-6 through a visual, child-friendly interface requiring no reading ability
- Reduce parental supervision from constant oversight to one-time setup through automated content curation
- Establish healthy screen time boundaries with automatic daily viewing limits (5 videos)
- Maintain engaging content freshness with 20-40% rewatch rate within 7-day periods (balancing novelty with comfort of familiar favorites)
- Create a frustration-free experience for both children and parents by removing content negotiation conflicts
- Enable simple content source management pi direct URL pasting or name entry for both channels and playlists

## Background Context

Parents struggle with YouTube's recommendation-driven model that optimizes for engagement over child safety, leading to inappropriate content discovery even within YouTube Kids. Current parental controls are either too complex or ineffective, requiring constant supervision and creating frequent conflicts when parents must deny video choices. This solution addresses the gap by providing complete parental control over content sources while maintaining the engaging visual selection experience children expect. By limiting content to pre-approved channels and playlists only and removing all discovery mechanisms, the application transforms YouTube from an open-ended platform into a curated, safe viewing environment that respects both child development needs and parental peace of mind. The interface uses Norwegian for all UI elements while allowing video content in any language.
