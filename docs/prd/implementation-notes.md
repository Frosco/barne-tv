# Implementation Notes

**Epic Restructure Rationale:**
- Resolves circular dependency (Epic 1 can now be completed independently)
- Adds missing foundational infrastructure (testing, frontend, design system)
- Proper sequencing of dependencies (API setup before usage)
- Clear deployment path with dedicated Epic 5

**Development Sequence:**
1. Complete Epic 1 → Delivers foundation + content management capability
2. Complete Epic 2 → Delivers functional child viewing experience
3. Complete Epic 3 → Delivers complete parent management
4. Complete Epic 4 → Delivers full MVP with time limits and enhancements
5. Complete Epic 5 → Delivers production-ready deployment

**Total Stories:** 19 (8+3+3+5+5)  
**Estimated Effort:** Epic 1: 2-3 weeks | Epic 2: 1 week | Epic 3: 1 week | Epic 4: 1-2 weeks | Epic 5: 1 week
