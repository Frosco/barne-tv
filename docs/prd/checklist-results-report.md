# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall PRD Completeness:** 87%
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready
- **Most Critical Gaps:** Non-functional requirements (backup/recovery, monitoring), operational requirements

## Category Analysis

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None critical   |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | None critical   |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS    | None critical   |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | None critical   |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PARTIAL | Backup/recovery, monitoring not defined |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | None critical   |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None critical   |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data retention, monitoring gaps |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | Could use diagrams |

## Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- Clear problem definition with specific target users
- Well-structured epics delivering incremental value
- Comprehensive functional requirements with testable acceptance criteria
- Technical approach optimized for simplicity (RSS feeds, minimal dependencies)
- Strong focus on child safety and user experience

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Add backup/recovery strategy for SQLite database
- Define monitoring and alerting approach
- Specify data retention policies for watch history
- Consider adding architecture diagrams
- Document deployment process more explicitly

## MVP Validation

The MVP scope is appropriately sized for initial deployment:
- Core viewing experience can be deployed after Epic 1
- Parent controls add essential management without blocking functionality
- Enhancement features in Epic 3 can be iteratively added
- Technical choices (RSS feeds) minimize complexity and API dependencies

## Technical Readiness Assessment

The PRD provides sufficient technical guidance for architecture phase:
- Clear technology stack decisions (FastAPI, vanilla JS, SQLite)
- Integration approach well-defined (RSS for channels, API for playlists)
- Deployment target specified (Hetzner VPS)
- Security considerations addressed (password protection, no indexing)
