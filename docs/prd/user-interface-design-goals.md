# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A colorful, playful interface that empowers young children to make independent choices within parent-defined boundaries. The design eliminates cognitive overload through simplicity - no text-dependent navigation, no complex menus, no infinite scrolling. Every interaction should feel predictable and safe, like choosing toys from a toy box rather than navigating a store.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Visual-First Selection:** Large, clear thumbnails as the only decision point
- **Single-Click Simplicity:** One click to select, automatic progression
- **Predictable Returns:** Always return to the same home grid after videos
- **Gentle Boundaries:** Soft transitions when limits are reached, not abrupt stops
- **Invisible Complexity:** All configuration hidden behind parent gateway
- **Audio Feedback:** Playful sounds confirm actions (with disable option)

## Core Screens and Views
- **Home Grid View:** The main selection interface with configurable video thumbnails
- **Video Playback View:** Fullscreen video with YouTube's standard hover progress bar
- **Wind-Down Transition Screen:** Softer visual/audio cue when approaching time limit
- **Daily Limit Reached Screen:** Friendly goodbye with tomorrow's promise featuring mascot
- **Grace Video Selection:** Filtered grid showing only short videos for "one more"
- **Parent Gateway:** Simple password entry to access management
- **Channel Management Dashboard:** Add/remove sources, configure settings
- **Settings Panel:** Grid size, time limits, sound toggles, and other preferences
- **Video History View:** Parent-accessible list of recently watched videos for manual replay

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Standard web accessibility compliance ensuring the app is usable by parents and children with various needs.

## Branding
- **Visual Style:** Bright, colorful design with yellow as accent color among rainbow palette
- **Typography:** Large, friendly fonts for the Norwegian UI text
- **Animation:** Playful, bouncy transitions between states
- **Sound Design:** Cheerful selection sounds and gentle notifications (optional via settings)
- **Character/Mascot:** Friendly animated character for transitions and limit messages

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
- **Primary:** Laptop/desktop computers with mouse interaction
- **Secondary:** Tablet support with touch optimization
- **Responsive design** adapting to both device types
- Landscape orientation preferred for video viewing
- Click-first interactions with touch as progressive enhancement
