# Architecture Documentation - Sharded Structure

This directory contains the complete architecture documentation for Safe YouTube Viewer for Kids, organized into focused sections for easier navigation and maintenance.

## Overview

The original 8016-line `docs/architecture.md` has been sharded into 24 separate files:
- **23 section files** (one per level-2 heading from the original document)
- **1 index file** (`index.md`) with navigation and quick links

## Files Created

### Status & Overview (4 files)
- `document-status.md` - Completion status
- `table-of-contents.md` - Section listing
- `introduction.md` - Project overview
- `index.md` - Main navigation hub

### Architecture & Design (5 files)
- `high-level-architecture.md` - System architecture
- `tech-stack.md` - Technology selections
- `data-models.md` - Domain entities
- `components.md` - System components
- `core-workflows.md` - User journeys

### API & Integration (3 files)
- `api-specification.md` - REST API
- `external-apis.md` - YouTube integration
- `frontend-api-client-configuration.md` - API client

### Data & Storage (1 file)
- `database-schema.md` - SQLite schema

### Development & Operations (4 files)
- `development-workflow.md` - Local setup
- `source-tree-structure.md` - Repository organization
- `infrastructure-and-deployment.md` - Deployment (placeholder)
- `monitoring-and-observability.md` - Monitoring

### Quality & Standards (3 files)
- `coding-standards.md` - Mandatory rules
- `test-strategy-and-standards.md` - Testing approach
- `error-handling-strategy.md` - Error patterns

### Security & Accessibility (3 files)
- `security-implementation.md` - Security measures
- `security-summary.md` - Security overview
- `accessibility-implementation.md` - WCAG compliance

### Validation (1 file)
- `checklist-results-report.md` - Architecture validation

## Heading Level Adjustments

All sections have had their heading levels adjusted:
- Level 2 (`##`) became Level 1 (`#`) - the section title
- Level 3 (`###`) became Level 2 (`##`)
- Level 4 (`####`) became Level 3 (`###`)
- And so on...

This ensures each section file is a standalone document with a proper title.

## File Statistics

- **Total files**: 24 (23 sections + 1 index)
- **Total lines**: 8076 (vs 8016 in original, extra from index.md)
- **Largest file**: `security-implementation.md` (1237 lines)
- **Smallest file**: `infrastructure-and-deployment.md` (6 lines - placeholder)

## Usage

Start with `index.md` for navigation and quick links to all sections.

### For AI Agents
1. Read `coding-standards.md` first (TIER 1 rules are mandatory)
2. Reference `api-specification.md` and `data-models.md`
3. Follow `core-workflows.md` for implementation guidance

### For Understanding
1. Start with `introduction.md`
2. Review `high-level-architecture.md`
3. Explore `core-workflows.md` for user journeys

### For Security & Testing
1. `security-implementation.md` - All security measures
2. `test-strategy-and-standards.md` - Testing approach
3. `accessibility-implementation.md` - WCAG compliance

## Maintenance

When updating architecture:
1. Update individual section files (not the original `docs/architecture.md`)
2. Keep heading levels consistent (level 1 for section title)
3. Update `index.md` if adding/removing sections
