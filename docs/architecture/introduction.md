# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Safe YouTube Viewer for Kids**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for this focused, single-purpose application where backend and frontend concerns are tightly integrated around the child viewing experience.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** N/A - Greenfield project

**Rationale:** This is a custom application with unique requirements (child safety, Norwegian UI, specific YouTube integration patterns) that don't align well with standard starters. The "minimal dependencies" and "no build step if possible" goals favor a from-scratch approach using vanilla technologies.

**Deployment Model:** Self-hosted on Hetzner VPS with direct systemd service management. No containerization needed for this single-instance family deployment.
