# Security Summary

**Strong protections implemented:**
- ✅ Bcrypt password hashing for admin authentication
- ✅ HTTPS with strong TLS configuration (Let's Encrypt)
- ✅ Comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- ✅ Input validation via Pydantic models
- ✅ SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- ✅ XSS prevention via safe DOM manipulation
- ✅ Rate limiting to prevent abuse (admin: 10/min, child: 60/min)
- ✅ Server hardening (UFW firewall, fail2ban, security updates)
- ✅ Application user isolation (non-root, restricted permissions)
- ✅ Secure environment variable handling
- ✅ SEO/crawler prevention (robots.txt, noindex/nofollow/noarchive headers)
- ✅ Comprehensive security testing (TIER 1: 100% coverage)

**Pragmatic simplifications (justified for single-family deployment):**
- ✅ In-memory sessions (acceptable for single instance, simplifies architecture)
- ✅ No encryption at rest (no sensitive data, physical security adequate)
- ✅ Manual monitoring (appropriate for family scale, weekly/monthly checklists provided)
- ✅ Simple auth model (no OAuth complexity, bcrypt sufficient)
- ✅ No CORS middleware (monolith serves frontend and API from same origin)

**Defense in depth:**
- Multiple security layers (Nginx, FastAPI, application logic, database)
- Principle of least privilege throughout (file permissions, user isolation, systemd hardening)
- Security monitoring and incident response procedures
- Comprehensive security testing integrated into development workflow
