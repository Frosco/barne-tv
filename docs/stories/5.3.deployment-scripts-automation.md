# Story 5.3: Deployment Scripts & Automation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As an** operations team member,
**I want** automated deployment scripts,
**so that** updates can be deployed safely and consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. deploy.sh script created for deployment automation
2. Script pulls latest code from repository
3. Script validates environment variables present in .env (DATABASE_PATH, YOUTUBE_API_KEY, etc.)
4. Script runs database migrations if needed
5. Script installs/updates backend dependencies: `uv sync --extra dev`
6. Script runs backend code quality checks: `black .`, `ruff check .`, `mypy backend/`
7. Script runs TIER 1 safety tests: `pytest -m tier1 -v` (DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER - must pass 100%)
8. Script verifies backend coverage: `pytest --cov=backend --cov-report=term` (target: 85%+)
9. Script verifies no async/await in backend code (architectural constraint check)
10. Script builds frontend: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build` (outputs to static/)
11. Script runs frontend code quality checks: `npm run lint`, `npm run format`
12. Script verifies frontend tests pass: `npm test`
13. Script performs WAL checkpoint: `sqlite3 data/app.db "PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(FULL)"`
14. Script restarts systemd service: `systemctl restart youtube-viewer.service`
15. Script waits for service to be fully ready (5-10 seconds)
16. Script checks health endpoint: `curl -f http://localhost:8000/health` (must return 200)
17. Script verifies health endpoint checks database connectivity
18. Script includes rollback procedure if deployment fails (restore previous code, restart service)
19. Script logs all actions with timestamps to deployment log
20. Script exits with non-zero code if any step fails
21. Script executable by designated user (not root, youtube-viewer group)
22. Script creates deployment log: `/opt/youtube-viewer/logs/deployments.log`

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights (Story 5.2)

**Application Deployment Status:**
- Repository cloned: `https://github.com/Frosco/barne-tv` at `/opt/youtube-viewer/app/`
- Backend dependencies: 70 packages installed (including bcrypt 5.0.0)
- Frontend built: 57KB total assets in `static/`
- Database initialized: `/opt/youtube-viewer/data/app.db` (139KB, WAL mode enabled)
- Service: `youtube-viewer.service` running and enabled
- Admin password: 32-character secure password set
- ALLOWED_HOSTS: Updated to include `localhost,127.0.0.1` for health checks

**All-Synchronous Architecture (CRITICAL):**
[Source: Story 5.2 Dev Notes, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#tier-3]

The backend is **intentionally synchronous-only** with NO async/await anywhere. This is a fundamental architectural constraint that must be verified during deployment.

**Why this matters for deployment:**
- AC 9 requires checking that no async/await appears in backend code
- Use: `grep -r "async def\|await " backend/` to verify
- If found, deployment MUST fail (architectural violation)
- FastAPI handles synchronous routes in thread pool automatically
- Workers=1 configuration enforced (single-worker for in-memory sessions)

### Database Architecture and WAL Checkpoints

**SQLite WAL Mode:**
[Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md, Story 5.2 Production Files]

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;  -- Write-Ahead Logging enabled
```

**WAL Checkpoint for Deployment (AC 13):**
- **Purpose:** Ensures all WAL file changes are checkpointed to main database before service restart
- **Command:** `sqlite3 /opt/youtube-viewer/data/app.db "PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(FULL);"`
- **FULL mode:** Blocks until all frames are checkpointed and WAL file is reset
- **When to run:** Before service restart to ensure database consistency
- **Failure handling:** Log warning but continue (not a deployment blocker)

**Why checkpoint before restart:**
- WAL file contains uncommitted changes that need to be persisted
- Service restart might lose WAL file if not checkpointed
- Ensures database consistency across deployments

### Backend Quality Checks and Testing

**Code Quality Tools:**
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

```bash
# Formatter (check only, don't auto-fix in deploy)
uv run black . --check

# Linter
uv run ruff check .

# Type checker
uv run mypy backend/
```

**All checks MUST pass for deployment to proceed. Exit code 0 = pass, non-zero = fail.**

**Testing Framework:**
[Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

```bash
# TIER 1 Safety Tests (DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER - AC 7)
uv run pytest -m tier1 -v

# Coverage Check (target 85%+ - AC 8)
uv run pytest --cov=backend --cov-report=term
```

**TIER 1 Tests - CRITICAL:**
- Test the 6 child safety rules from coding-standards.md
- Located in: `tests/backend/safety/test_tier1_safety_rules.py`
- Marked with: `@pytest.mark.tier1`
- **100% MUST PASS** - Any failure blocks deployment immediately
- Tests: banned video filtering, time limit calculation, UTC times, bcrypt passwords, SQL injection prevention, SQL parameterization

**Coverage Target:**
- Backend: 85%+ (log warning if below, but don't block)
- Parse output: Look for "TOTAL" line with percentage
- Coverage check is informational, not a deployment blocker

### Frontend Build and Quality Checks

**Frontend Build Pipeline:**
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, CLAUDE.md]

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend && npm install

# Build for production (outputs to ../static/)
npm run build

# Verify build output
ls -lh ../static/assets/
```

**Build Output:**
- Vite builds to `static/` directory (from frontend root: `../static/`)
- Assets in `static/assets/`: `admin.js`, `child.js`, `main.css`
- Typical size: ~57KB total
- Nginx serves static files from `/opt/youtube-viewer/app/static/`

**Frontend Quality Checks:**
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, package.json]

```bash
# Linter (ESLint 9.x flat config)
npm run lint

# Formatter check (Prettier - check mode)
npm run format -- --check

# Unit tests (Vitest + happy-dom)
npm test
```

**All checks MUST pass for deployment to proceed.**

### Health Check Verification

**Health Endpoint Specification:**
[Source: Epic 5 Story 5.4 AC 1-2, Story 5.2 Completion Notes]

```bash
# Health check with curl -f (fail on non-2xx)
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Expected Response (AC 17):**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-12T10:30:00Z",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

**Verification Requirements:**
- HTTP 200 status code
- JSON response with `status: "ok"`
- Database connectivity verified: `database: "connected"`
- Endpoint accessible via localhost (ALLOWED_HOSTS includes "localhost,127.0.0.1")

**Failure Handling:**
If health check fails after service restart, trigger rollback procedure (AC 18).

### Rollback Procedure Architecture

**Rollback Strategy (AC 18):**
[Source: Epic 5 AC 18, Story requirements]

When deployment fails at any step:
1. Log failure reason and initiating rollback
2. Restore previous code: `git reset --hard $PREVIOUS_COMMIT`
3. Rebuild frontend: `cd frontend && npm run build`
4. Restart service: `sudo systemctl restart youtube-viewer.service`
5. Wait 5 seconds and verify health endpoint
6. Log rollback completion
7. Exit with error code 1

**Git Commit Tracking:**
- Store commit before pull: `PREVIOUS_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`
- Store commit after pull: `NEW_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`
- Use `$PREVIOUS_COMMIT` for rollback

**Critical Notes:**
- Rollback MUST run even if script fails mid-execution (use trap handler)
- Frontend rebuild required after git reset (static/ is gitignored)
- Service restart ensures application runs rolled-back code
- Health check after rollback ensures system is operational

### Deployment Logging and Script Permissions

**Deployment Log (AC 19, 22):**
[Source: Epic 5 AC 19, 22, Story 5.1 directory structure]

```bash
LOG_FILE="/opt/youtube-viewer/logs/deployments.log"
```

**Log Format:**
- ISO 8601 timestamps for each action
- Clear step descriptions
- Success/failure status for each step
- Git commit SHAs (previous and new)
- Test results, coverage percentages, health check responses
- Rollback actions if triggered

**Script Permissions (AC 21):**
[Source: Epic 5 AC 21, Story 5.1 directory permissions]

```bash
# Script location
/opt/youtube-viewer/app/scripts/deploy.sh

# Permissions: 750 (owner+group execute, not world)
chmod 750 scripts/deploy.sh

# Owner: youtube-viewer:youtube-viewer
chown youtube-viewer:youtube-viewer scripts/deploy.sh
```

**Execution Context:**
- Script runs as user in youtube-viewer group (not root)
- Requires sudo permission for: `systemctl restart youtube-viewer.service`
- No sudo required for: git, uv, npm, sqlite3, curl commands

### Environment Variables and Validation

**Required Environment Variables (AC 3):**
[Source: Story 5.1 AC 21-22, Story 5.2 Dev Notes]

```bash
# .env location: /opt/youtube-viewer/.env (permissions 600)
DATABASE_PATH=/opt/youtube-viewer/data/app.db
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=AIzaSyD...  # Must be valid API key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=refsnes-barnetv.no,localhost,127.0.0.1
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_FILE=/opt/youtube-viewer/logs/app.log
```

**Validation Requirements:**
1. Check .env file exists
2. Verify all 6 required variables are present (not empty)
3. Exit with error code 1 if validation fails
4. Log validation results

   - Verify deployment log contains all steps

2. **TIER 1 Test Failure:**
   - Introduce failing TIER 1 test
   - Deploy should fail at AC 7
   - Rollback should trigger automatically
   - Previous commit should be restored
   - Service should run previous version

3. **Health Check Failure:**
   - Break health endpoint temporarily
   - Deploy should fail at AC 16
   - Rollback should restore working version
   - Verify health check passes after rollback

4. **Quality Check Failure:**
   - Introduce linting error
