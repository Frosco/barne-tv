# Safe YouTube Viewer for Kids Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Eliminate 100% of inappropriate content exposure by restricting videos exclusively to parent-approved YouTube channels and playlists
- Enable independent video selection for children ages 2-6 through a visual, child-friendly interface requiring no reading ability
- Reduce parental supervision from constant oversight to one-time setup through automated content curation
- Establish healthy screen time boundaries with automatic daily viewing limits (5 videos)
- Maintain engaging content freshness with 20-40% rewatch rate within 7-day periods (balancing novelty with comfort of familiar favorites)
- Create a frustration-free experience for both children and parents by removing content negotiation conflicts
- Enable simple content source management pi direct URL pasting or name entry for both channels and playlists

### Background Context

Parents struggle with YouTube's recommendation-driven model that optimizes for engagement over child safety, leading to inappropriate content discovery even within YouTube Kids. Current parental controls are either too complex or ineffective, requiring constant supervision and creating frequent conflicts when parents must deny video choices. This solution addresses the gap by providing complete parental control over content sources while maintaining the engaging visual selection experience children expect. By limiting content to pre-approved channels and playlists only and removing all discovery mechanisms, the application transforms YouTube from an open-ended platform into a curated, safe viewing environment that respects both child development needs and parental peace of mind. The interface uses Norwegian for all UI elements while allowing video content in any language.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
A colorful, playful interface that empowers young children to make independent choices within parent-defined boundaries. The design eliminates cognitive overload through simplicity - no text-dependent navigation, no complex menus, no infinite scrolling. Every interaction should feel predictable and safe, like choosing toys from a toy box rather than navigating a store.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Visual-First Selection:** Large, clear thumbnails as the only decision point
- **Single-Click Simplicity:** One click to select, automatic progression
- **Predictable Returns:** Always return to the same home grid after videos
- **Gentle Boundaries:** Soft transitions when limits are reached, not abrupt stops
- **Invisible Complexity:** All configuration hidden behind parent gateway
- **Audio Feedback:** Playful sounds confirm actions (with disable option)

### Core Screens and Views
- **Home Grid View:** The main selection interface with configurable video thumbnails
- **Video Playback View:** Fullscreen video with YouTube's standard hover progress bar
- **Wind-Down Transition Screen:** Softer visual/audio cue when approaching time limit
- **Daily Limit Reached Screen:** Friendly goodbye with tomorrow's promise featuring mascot
- **Grace Video Selection:** Filtered grid showing only short videos for "one more"
- **Parent Gateway:** Simple password entry to access management
- **Channel Management Dashboard:** Add/remove sources, configure settings
- **Settings Panel:** Grid size, time limits, sound toggles, and other preferences
- **Video History View:** Parent-accessible list of recently watched videos for manual replay

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Standard web accessibility compliance ensuring the app is usable by parents and children with various needs.

### Branding
- **Visual Style:** Bright, colorful design with yellow as accent color among rainbow palette
- **Typography:** Large, friendly fonts for the Norwegian UI text
- **Animation:** Playful, bouncy transitions between states
- **Sound Design:** Cheerful selection sounds and gentle notifications (optional via settings)
- **Character/Mascot:** Friendly animated character for transitions and limit messages

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
- **Primary:** Laptop/desktop computers with mouse interaction
- **Secondary:** Tablet support with touch optimization
- **Responsive design** adapting to both device types
- Landscape orientation preferred for video viewing
- Click-first interactions with touch as progressive enhancement

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

### Service Architecture: Monolith

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology:**
- Vanilla JavaScript with minimal dependencies (no build step if possible)
- Simple DOM manipulation for the video grid

### Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- Clear problem definition with specific target users
- Well-structured epics delivering incremental value
- Comprehensive functional requirements with testable acceptance criteria
- Technical approach optimized for simplicity (RSS feeds, minimal dependencies)
- Strong focus on child safety and user experience

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Add backup/recovery strategy for SQLite database
- Define monitoring and alerting approach
- Specify data retention policies for watch history
- Consider adding architecture diagrams
- Document deployment process more explicitly

### MVP Validation

The MVP scope is appropriately sized for initial deployment:
- Core viewing experience can be deployed after Epic 1
- Parent controls add essential management without blocking functionality
- Enhancement features in Epic 3 can be iteratively added
- Technical choices (RSS feeds) minimize complexity and API dependencies

### Technical Readiness Assessment

The PRD provides sufficient technical guidance for architecture phase:
- Clear technology stack decisions (FastAPI, vanilla JS, SQLite)
- Integration approach well-defined (RSS for channels, API for playlists)
- Deployment target specified (Hetzner VPS)
- Security considerations addressed (password protection, no indexing)

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please review the Safe YouTube Viewer for Kids PRD and create detailed UI/UX specifications focusing on the child-friendly visual interface, colorful grid layout with yellow accents, and the friendly mascot character for transitions. Ensure all interactions are optimized for non-readers ages 2-6.

### Architect Prompt

Please create the technical architecture for the Safe YouTube Viewer for Kids application using the PRD as input. Focus on the FastAPI/vanilla JS stack with RSS feed integration for channels and YouTube API for playlists, SQLite storage, and simple deployment to Hetzner VPS. Emphasize simplicity and minimal dependencies.
